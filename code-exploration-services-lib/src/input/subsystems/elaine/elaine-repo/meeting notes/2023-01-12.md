# Summary 
- We discussed several tangentially related things:
  - Effects appearing multiple times in the row (related to footnote 1 in the hefty algebras paper)
  - Restricting effects (possibly related to effect tunneling)
  - Other effect libraries and how they represent row types (e.g. freer-simple represents effects as type-level Haskell lists).

- The plan stays the same but is a bit more clear:

  - I will make a DSL with support for hefty algebras
  - The DSL has a core language and a surface language
  - The core language has a distinction between elaboration of higher-order and handling of algebraic effects
  - The surface language abstracts over this distinction and only exposes a handler construct that can do both higher-order and algebraic effects.
  - The core language will be based on the core language in https://www.eff-lang.org/handlers-tutorial.pdf and the hefty algebras paper.
  - It will not feature syntactic sugar like implicit bind/do-notation like in Koka. Those can be left to the surface language or left out entirely.
  - The most important part is the translation of the handler in the surface language into the core language, which must be proven sound and well-typed.

- Figuring out the core language will be the first step, based on which I can start the implementation.
- I will also come up with examples that could inform the design in addition to the catch example.
