- See design questions in design_space.md
  - We specify multiple operations, some of which are higher order, what are the
    return types of handling them?
  ```rust
  handler hExc: <Exc> a -> Maybe[a] {
      return(x: a) -> Maybe[a] {...}
      throw() -> Maybe[a] {...}
      // Or should catch have `-> Maybe[a]` as well?
      catch(m1: <Exc> a, m2: <Exc> a) -> <Exc> a {...}
  }
  ```
  - How is the type of the elaboration defined?
    - Do the effects that we elaborate into need to be defined explicitly?
    - Are those identical to the effects in the handler return type?
  - Do we need computation type (I think functions are enough).
  - How do we rewrite operations with both value and computation parameters?
    This would make the whole thing truly seamless.
  - Elaborating into other effects is tricky, see optionally transactional
    exception catching, because higher-order operations do that but others don't.
