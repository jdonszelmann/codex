# Meeting 2023-05-23

## Changes since last time:

- Elaborations work now
- Elaborations no longer need to elaborate everything (because they can now do
  single elabs)
- There's a new typing rule for opening effect rows
- This was necessary for function arguments
- Implicit elaborations work
- New row representation
- New row forcing and unification
- There's now forcing, which is one-way unification and defined separately
  because of some edge cases
- Forcing is used for type annotations and is much more robust than unifying and
  checking whether the type annotation was unchanged.
- afaik unification and forcing cannot be combined easily, but they're both not
  very big
- Some fixes around rows for function application
- Transforms are redefined in terms of a fold
- Types for the type checker are now separate from types for the AST, so that we
  can resolve types. This is necessary to, for example, distinguish between
  effects defined in different modules.

## What's missing:

- Custom data types & match
- Effects polymorphic over types
- Checking type checking results for the whole env for better tests

## New row representation:

- Rows are now modelled with multisets internally, which makes them easier to
  reason about

## New row unification:

- There was a problem for <A|e1> and <B|e2>, which should be unified with the
  substitutions `e1 -> <B|e3>` and `e2 -> <A|e3>`
- That wasn't supported, but is now.
- Forcing does not include the rule above, because it would require using
  substitution on the left-hand argument

## Implicit elaboration

- There's an "explicit" command
- "run" first transforms the program and then runs it
- Only necessary elaborations are added
- I need to figure out a way to test this properly

## Writing

(* = start there)

- Structure:
  - * Introduction (make contributions very clear)
  - Background
    - algebraic effects
    - higher-order effects
    - elaborations, etc.
  - Related work (Koka, Frank, Eff)
  - * Basic language design
    - examples
    - elaborations from hefty algebras paper
    - relation to hefty algebras
    - spec
      - syntax
      - reduction semantics
      - typing rules & row equivalence
      - type checker? Unification rules etc.
  - Special features:
    - implicit elaboration resolution
    - transform elab to handle
      - relation to dictionary passing
      - does it preserve well-typedness?
    - Explain why not syntactic transformations

  - Important to connect to hefty algebras
- Correctness of transformations
- Denotational semantics with hefty algebras (sketch)
- Soundness proof sketch
